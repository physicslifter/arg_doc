# arg_doc
framework for documenting all aspects of complicated arguments. In order to help people make up their mind about complex issues.

What should this framework be able to do?  
    1. create a new topic or question  
    2. create subquestions/subtopics for questions  
    3. Find a way to simplify things to: Do you think ...  
    4. Automate this process so that, like wikipedia, there are 2 distinct ends to this platform:  
      i. People interested in various aspects of issues can break down the issues into their constituent relevant elements. The process should be such that users slowly add to the complexity until the issue at hand is broken down into several basic questions. It should be a live growing body of work, like wikipedia  
      ii. Users who want to make their decision about an issue can go to the site and answer several questions about what they think should and shouldn't happen. For example, to determine what one thinks about gun control, the issue might be broken down to five simple questions. Such a question might be: "An AR-15 holds such-and-such capacity of ammunition, shoots at such-and-such a rate, with such-and-such lethality. Is such a weapon more useful for self-defense than it is a threat to the common good?" Not a great question but there's an example. People could have to read and understand the question, then enter a relevant answer, then do this to the entire array of questions, and then their vote on the issue shall be determined. This system could replace the current voting system, where skeezy things get passed because nobody reads the whole thing.
